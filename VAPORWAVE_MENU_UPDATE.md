# Vaporwave Menu System Update

## Overview
Complete redesign of the PoorCraft menu system with **Vaporwave aesthetics**, **professional responsive design**, and the **Silkscreen retro font**.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **New VaporwaveButton Component**
   - File: `src/main/java/com/poorcraft/ui/VaporwaveButton.java`
   - Features:
     - Gradient backgrounds (pink/purple â†’ cyan/blue on hover)
     - Animated glow borders with multi-layer effects
     - Smooth hover transitions
     - Pulsing animation when hovered
     - Text shadows for better readability
     - Full support for disabled state

### 2. **MainMenuScreen - Complete Redesign**
   - File: `src/main/java/com/poorcraft/ui/MainMenuScreen.java`
   - Features:
     - **Fully responsive layout** - adapts to any window size
     - Vaporwave gradient background (purple â†’ blue)
     - Animated scanline effect for retro CRT look
     - New color scheme:
       - Title: Electric cyan
       - Subtitle: Hot pink
       - Footer: Purple tint
     - All buttons use new VaporwaveButton component
     - Smart sizing constraints (min/max bounds)

### 3. **PauseScreen - Matching Design**
   - File: `src/main/java/com/poorcraft/ui/PauseScreen.java`
   - Features:
     - Same Vaporwave aesthetic as main menu
     - Semi-transparent gradient overlay
     - Pulsing scanline animation
     - Responsive button layout
     - Helpful "Press ESC to resume" hint

### 4. **Silkscreen Font Integration**
   - Copied fonts to: `src/main/resources/fonts/`
     - Silkscreen-Regular.ttf
     - Silkscreen-Bold.ttf
   - Updated `UIManager.java` to load Silkscreen font (size 20px)
   - Retro pixelated aesthetic perfect for the Vaporwave theme

## Responsive Design Features

### Window Resizing
The menu now **automatically adapts** to any window size:

- **Buttons**: Scale between 280px-500px width based on screen size
- **Spacing**: Proportional to button height
- **Title**: Scales from 40px-80px based on window height
- **Layout**: Always centered vertically and horizontally
- **Minimum sizes**: Ensures readability on small screens
- **Maximum sizes**: Prevents awkward scaling on ultra-wide displays

### How It Works
When the window is resized:
1. `onResize()` is called with new dimensions
2. Layout is completely rebuilt with `init()`
3. All sizes and positions recalculated
4. Components maintain perfect proportions

## Color Palette

### Vaporwave Colors Used:
- **Electric Cyan**: `RGB(0, 242, 242)` - Titles, hover states
- **Hot Pink**: `RGB(250, 66, 160)` - Accents, normal buttons
- **Deep Purple**: `RGB(102, 56, 184)` - Gradients, backgrounds
- **Indigo**: `RGB(74, 0, 130)` - Dark gradients
- **Dark Purple/Blue**: Background gradients

## Testing the Menu

### To Test:
1. Run the game: `.\run-poorcraft.bat` or `.\run-poorcraft.ps1`
2. Main menu should appear with Vaporwave design
3. Try resizing the window - watch buttons adapt smoothly
4. Hover over buttons - see the gradient and glow effects
5. Start a game and press ESC - pause menu has matching design

### Expected Behavior:
âœ… Buttons have gradient backgrounds  
âœ… Hover effects are smooth and animated  
âœ… Glow borders pulse on hover  
âœ… Text uses Silkscreen retro font  
âœ… Layout stays centered on resize  
âœ… Background has subtle scanline animation  
âœ… All buttons properly aligned and sized  

## Technical Details

### Animation System:
- `animationTime` tracks elapsed time
- Scanlines move continuously for retro effect
- Hover effects smoothly interpolate (8x speed)
- Pulse effects use sine wave

### Performance:
- Gradient backgrounds: 20-40 steps (smooth but efficient)
- Glow borders: 3 layers for blur effect
- All animations optimized for 60+ FPS

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `src/main/java/com/poorcraft/ui/VaporwaveButton.java` (NEW)
2. âœ… `src/main/java/com/poorcraft/ui/MainMenuScreen.java` (UPDATED)
3. âœ… `src/main/java/com/poorcraft/ui/PauseScreen.java` (UPDATED)
4. âœ… `src/main/java/com/poorcraft/ui/UIManager.java` (UPDATED - font path)
5. âœ… `src/main/resources/fonts/Silkscreen-Regular.ttf` (ADDED)
6. âœ… `src/main/resources/fonts/Silkscreen-Bold.ttf` (ADDED)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add VaporwaveButton to other menus (Settings, Multiplayer, etc.)
- Implement animated background with moving grid lines
- Add sound effects for button clicks (synthwave sounds?)
- Create custom cursor for full aesthetic
- Add particle effects on button hover

## Notes

- The compiler warning about JRE 17 vs 21 is harmless (project configured for Java 17)
- Font fallback is handled gracefully if Silkscreen fails to load
- All existing button functionality preserved (click callbacks, disabled states)
- Comments include retro gaming references for authenticity
