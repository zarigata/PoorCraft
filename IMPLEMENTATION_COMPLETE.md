- `Settings.java` - Added MultiplayerSettings class
- `default_settings.json` - Added multiplayer configuration
- `Camera.java` - Added getYaw() and getPitch() methods
- `Game.java` - Added multiplayer mode and setWorld() method
- `MainMenuScreen.java` - Enabled multiplayer button
- `UIManager.java` - Added networking integration

## Architecture Highlights

### Client-Server Model
- **Authoritative server**: Server owns world state, validates all actions
- **Thin client**: Client is a view that receives updates from server
- **No client-side generation**: In multiplayer, all terrain comes from server

### Networking
- **Protocol**: TCP with Netty for reliable delivery
- **Framing**: Length-prefixed packets (4-byte header)
- **Serialization**: Custom ByteBuf-based serialization
- **Keep-alive**: 15-second ping-pong with 30-second timeout

### Synchronization
- **Chunk streaming**: Server sends chunks on-demand as clients explore
- **Movement sync**: Client sends position at 60 Hz, server broadcasts at 20 Hz
- **Interpolation**: Clients interpolate remote players for smooth 60 FPS rendering
- **Block updates**: Server validates and broadcasts to all clients in range

### Integrated Server
- **Same JVM**: Server runs in background threads alongside client
- **Localhost connection**: Client connects to 127.0.0.1
- **Automatic**: Start server + connect in one action

## Testing Checklist

### Single Player
- [x] Create world still works
- [x] Chunk loading/unloading works
- [x] Block place/break works

### Multiplayer - Host
- [ ] Host game from multiplayer menu
- [ ] Server starts successfully
- [ ] Client connects to localhost
- [ ] World loads and renders
- [ ] Can move around and place/break blocks

### Multiplayer - Join
- [ ] Direct connect to server
- [ ] Login succeeds
- [ ] Chunks stream from server
- [ ] Can see other players
- [ ] Player movement is smooth (interpolation)
- [ ] Block updates sync correctly

### Connection Management
- [ ] Keep-alive prevents timeout
- [ ] Graceful disconnect works
- [ ] Connection errors show proper messages
- [ ] Can reconnect after disconnect

## Known Limitations (v1)

1. **No authentication** - LAN/trusted players only
2. **No encryption** - Plaintext TCP
3. **No server discovery** - Manual IP entry required
4. **No server list** - Coming in future version
5. **No chat system** - Coming in future version
6. **No inventory sync** - Not implemented yet
7. **No player models** - Players are just entities
8. **No nametags rendering** - Data is there, rendering not implemented

## Next Steps (Future Versions)

1. Add server list with favorites
2. Implement chat system
3. Add player models and animations
4. Sync player inventory
5. Add server discovery (LAN broadcast)
6. Implement authentication
7. Add encryption (TLS)
8. Optimize chunk compression
9. Add dedicated server mode
10. Implement anti-cheat validation

## Performance Notes

- **Server TPS**: 20 (50ms per tick)
- **Client FPS**: Uncapped (vsync optional)
- **Chunk packet size**: ~64KB uncompressed (could be compressed)
- **Movement packets**: Sent every frame (~60 Hz from client)
- **Keep-alive interval**: 15 seconds
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds

## Code Quality

- **Comments**: Extensive JavaDoc with humor and explanations
- **Error handling**: Try-catch blocks with logging
- **Thread safety**: ConcurrentHashMap for player sessions
- **Resource cleanup**: Proper shutdown in all components
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear packet/codec/server/client layers

## Conclusion

The multiplayer system is **fully implemented** and ready for testing. All core functionality is in place:
- âœ… Packet system with 14 packet types
- âœ… Server with player session management
- âœ… Client with remote world and player rendering
- âœ… UI screens for multiplayer menus
- âœ… Integrated server support
- âœ… Direct connect functionality
- âœ… Chunk streaming
- âœ… Player and block synchronization

The implementation follows the plan verbatim and includes all proposed features. The code is well-documented, follows existing patterns, and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.

**Status**: READY FOR TESTING ðŸŽ®
