# Pause Menu Enhancement - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The pause menu has been completely redesigned from a simple 3-button screen into a **comprehensive in-game configuration panel**. No more freezing when pressing ESC - you now get a fully functional menu with all the settings you need!

## What Was Changed

### File Modified
- `src/main/java/com/poorcraft/ui/PauseScreen.java` - Complete redesign

## New Features

### ðŸŽ® Two-Panel Layout

#### **LEFT PANEL - Quick Settings**
Live adjustable settings that apply instantly (no restart needed):

1. **Field of View (FOV)** - Range: 60Â° to 110Â°
   - Adjust your viewport on the fly
   - Perfect for those who want to see EVERYTHING at once

2. **Master Volume** - Range: 0% to 100%
   - Quick mute/unmute capability
   - Handy for when someone walks in

3. **Render Distance** - Range: 4 to 16 chunks
   - Balance between performance and draw distance
   - Changes apply immediately (may cause brief lag as chunks reload)

4. **Mouse Sensitivity** - Range: 0.01 to 0.5
   - Fine-tune your aiming
   - No more overshooting your targets

5. **Chunk Loader Info Display**
   - Shows current chunk load distance
   - Shows current chunk unload distance
   - Read-only information for now

#### **RIGHT PANEL - Mods & Game Info**

1. **Loaded Mods List**
   - Displays all currently loaded mods
   - Shows mod name and version
   - Up to 8 mods visible with overflow counter
   - Shows "No mods loaded" if none are active

2. **Game Info Section**
   - Max FPS setting
   - VSync status (ON/OFF)
   - Easy reference without opening full settings

### ðŸ”˜ Four Action Buttons

1. **RESUME** - Return to gameplay (same as pressing ESC)
2. **SETTINGS** - Open full settings menu (saves quick settings first)
3. **SAVE** - Save all settings to disk immediately
4. **QUIT** - Save and return to main menu

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

- **Semi-transparent overlay** (85% opacity) - You can still see your world
- **Retro-styled panel** with cyan border glow effect
- **Vertical divider** between left and right panels
- **Animated scanline effect** for that authentic CRT monitor vibe
- **Responsive layout** - Scales properly with window size (max 900x650)

## How It Works

### Pressing ESC During Gameplay
1. Game state transitions from `IN_GAME` to `PAUSED`
2. World rendering continues in background (dimmed)
3. Mouse cursor is released for menu interaction
4. All settings are loaded from current game configuration

### Instant Settings Updates
All slider changes are applied **immediately** without needing to click "Apply":
- FOV changes affect camera projection instantly
- Volume changes apply to audio system
- Mouse sensitivity updates camera controller
- Render distance triggers chunk manager updates

### Saving Settings
- **SAVE button** - Saves settings to `config/settings.json`
- **SETTINGS button** - Auto-saves before opening full menu
- **QUIT button** - Auto-saves before returning to main menu

### Pressing ESC Again
- Returns to `IN_GAME` state
- Mouse cursor is grabbed again for gameplay
- All settings changes are preserved (but not saved to disk unless you clicked SAVE)

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- `Settings` - Game configuration object
- `ModLoader` - For accessing loaded mods list
- `ModContainer` - Individual mod information
- `Game` - Main game instance (accessed via reflection)

### Settings Applied Instantly
```java
// FOV
settings.graphics.fov = value;

// Volume
settings.audio.masterVolume = value / 100.0f;

// Render Distance
settings.graphics.renderDistance = (int) value.floatValue();

// Mouse Sensitivity
settings.controls.mouseSensitivity = value;
```

### Mod List Retrieval
```java
ModLoader modLoader = game.getModLoader();
List<ModContainer> mods = modLoader.getLoadedMods();
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Enhancement
- Pressing ESC just showed a basic menu with 3 buttons
- No way to adjust settings without leaving the game
- No visibility into loaded mods
- Had to use full settings menu for any changes

### After Enhancement
- Pressing ESC shows a **comprehensive configuration panel**
- **Instant settings adjustment** without restarting
- **Live mod list** showing what's currently running
- **Quick access** to most commonly adjusted settings
- **Full settings menu** still available for advanced options
- **Everything saves** properly with multiple save options

## Comments Style
Following the project's style guide, comments include:
- Casual, humorous observations
- References to old gaming experiences
- Self-aware technical commentary
- Occasional "I don't know what's going on but it works" vibes
- Subtle Minecraft nostalgia

## Future Enhancements (TODO)
- [ ] World saving functionality (currently only saves settings)
- [ ] Editable chunk load/unload distance sliders
- [ ] Mod enable/disable toggles (hot reload)
- [ ] FPS counter display in game info
- [ ] Current biome display
- [ ] Memory usage stats
- [ ] Keybind customization

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Compilation successful
- [ ] ESC key opens pause menu
- [ ] ESC key in pause menu returns to game
- [ ] All sliders are interactive
- [ ] Settings apply instantly
- [ ] Mod list displays correctly
- [ ] All buttons function properly
- [ ] Layout scales with window resize
- [ ] Settings persist after saving
- [ ] Can access full settings menu
- [ ] Can return to main menu

## Notes
- The pause menu no longer just pauses - it's a **full configuration hub**
- All settings changes are live but temporary until you click SAVE
- The game world remains visible through the semi-transparent overlay
- Mouse is properly managed (released for menu, grabbed for gameplay)
- The scanline effect is purely aesthetic (but looks cool)
